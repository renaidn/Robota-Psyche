# Reflection on Individual Presentation

My presentation was an attempt at discussing accountability questions in robots. I have touched on the current legal standing of robots, their rights, and their responsibilities. My discussion questions were concerning the necessity for robot rights, their rights in relation to human rights, and the power they get with acquiring their own rights.

### Content of Presentation

Honestly, I struggled a lot with the content of my presentation. I felt like the accountability question was too big to tackle in one presentation and wanted to narrow it down. For this reason, I have tried focusing on their accountability currently, which is little to none. I have brought up some cases that I found interesting and discussed them with the class.

### Follow-up Discussion

For the follow-up discussion, I was aiming to discuss robotsâ€™ legal status as to how we imagine seeing them. Right now we are just building up the foundation for robot rights, we have the freedom to imagine it and perhaps even shape it to some extent.
