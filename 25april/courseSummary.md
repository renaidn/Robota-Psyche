# Course Reflection (as of so far)

We are now nearing the end of the semester and it's about time that we reflect on the courses that we took and our feelings towards them. For me, Robota Psyche is one of the first interactive media electives that I took so far in my 4 years as an NYUAD Interactive Media major. 

### About Readings

We have weekly readings assigned for us to read by Monday each week. The readings are generally very interesting and not too academic in their style of writing. I see the reasons for which it is important to be exposed to academic language through readings, however, sometimes it feels like authors are gatekeeping the knowledge from its readers when they make it so academic that it’s not readable anymore. Maybe it is one of those things that I will understand when I get older. However, I am not that old yet and hence I enjoy the readers-friendly language in which most of the readings we had was written. To be completely honest, this is probably the only class for which I didn’t skip any of the readings. Out of all the readings we were assigned so far I enjoy reading stories from “I Robot” by Asimov the most. Perhaps, because it kind of makes the topic of robots more humane if it makes sense. 

### About Discussions

After each reading and presentation, we have a class discussion. Intriguing questions and interesting perspectives come up during that part of the class. Though everyone including the professor is making great attempts at providing us with more answers, there are still not enough of them. Back in high school, I was the type of person who didn’t want to have conversations about the things that don’t and probably won’t have answers. I thought that it was pointless and it made me a bit too anxious than I needed to be. Discussions that we are holding right now have a lot to do with the fate of humanity and the life that we may have in the nearest future, however, I am now less feared of those conversations. Probably because of the mood with which these discussions are held. Even with little knowledge that we have, we are still getting some steps closer to the clarity about the topic. Fantasizing about something so close and so distant is exciting. I love sharing the insights I have learned in class with my close friends and family. They usually have something to share about it too.

### About Technical Content

In order to understand robots, we need to make robots of some sort. In this class we are using Processing to make ecosystems and imitate life. In a way, we are also imitating a God for the habitats of these ecosystems because they follow the logic that we choose. I find the assignments that we have in this class fun because of the perspective that it gives me. I previously never thought that emotions are so easy to imitate. Makes me think a lot of how humans are actually not that cool haha. Maybe we get some additional coolness points for being able to create a new form of life of our own (robots).

### What Do I Feel About Robots?

In this class, we discuss robots and everything about them, but most importantly what concerns us personally about our present and future cohabitation with them. Previously, I would most likely say that I am scared of their abilities. After spending a day together, would they be able to imitate me in a way that people close to me will get confused as to which of us is the real me? It makes me think of this one [SpongeBob episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD1J7XOTjwY) where Plankton made a robot that looked like Mr.Krabs and spent the whole day with SpongeBob to gain his trust. When SpongeBob met both fake and real Mr.Krabs he asked a few personal questions to which the real Mr.Krabs couldn’t answer as fast and as precisely as its imitator, for which he was deemed as a fake by Spongebob. 

Currently, I feel like I must be scared of humans more than of robots. Would it be fair to punish a child that knows no better than what their parent taught them?
