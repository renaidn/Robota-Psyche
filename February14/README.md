<p>I was inspired by the picture above, which shows a pack of wolves following their alphas (male and female leaders). I am looking to recreate it in my project by
creating an <i> alpha </i> and a <i> pack </i> class with rules such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alpha is singular and is bigger in size compared to others in pack. The alpha is also the fastest one of all.</li>
  <li>The alpha directs the pack. The pack follows behind the alpha. There is always some space between the alpha and the pack. </li>
  <li>Members of the pack have different speeds (so that they don't end up looking like a singular dot on the screen).</li>
</ul>

<p>I had issues with making the pack members follow strictly behind the alpha, so it's something to work on. It also took me quite a while to figure out the
to figure out the proper directioning of the triangles.</p>
<p>The ecosystem is quite simplistic at the moment. In the future, I'd add: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a collision function (for the pack members not to cover one another),</li> 
  <li>make the direction of the alpha's movement more meaningful
    <ul>
      <li>perhaps it could be triggered by food (how would food consumption change the pack? would the alpha eat more than the rest?)</li> 
      <li>or the presence of enemies (if two rivaling pack members happen to touch one another would they die or get alienated from the pack?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also love to play around with the age setting (how would the new alpha be chosen after the death of its predecessor?).</p>
