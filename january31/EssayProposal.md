<b>Topic:</b> Accountability Gap in Robots
<br><br>
In search for an essay topic, I have got intrugued by the concept of fully autonomous robots, employed as autonomous weapon, who have the ability to choose its targets and proceed with actions without human evaluation and intervention. Refering to examples from popular media, we can imagine lots of ways in which this situation could go wrong. In my essay I would like to explore the ways in which robots as individuals and their developers as their "legal guardians" could be held accountable in cases where a mistake in robot's action would lead to a damage of any degree.
