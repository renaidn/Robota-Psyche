# Midterm Project: Pack Mentality
## Description #
In my midterm project I am looking to developing further the "pack mentality" ecosystem that I have worked on previously.
<br>
In my ecosystem there will be alpha, pack, and food. These are some of the rules which will be applied there:
<ul>
  <li>The alpha is singular for each pack and is bigger in size compared to others in its pack. The alpha is also the fastest one of all.</li>
  <li>The alpha directs the pack. The pack follows behind the alpha. </li>
  <li>Pack members are not all of the same size. Bigger pack members are stronger.</li>
  <li>There will be two rivalring packs on screen. In case if rivaling pack members touch one another, the smaller member dies.</li>
  <li>In case if alpha touch one another both packs start fighting till conflict resolves.</li>
  <li>Alpha will have maximum age. When it hits it, it will die. New alpha will be chosen from the pack members based on its size (the biggest one becomes new alpha).</li>
  <li>Pack size will have minimum value. When it hits it, new member of random size will be added to the pack.</li>
  <li>Alpha will have the need for food. If the need is satisfied they are not particularly interested in finding food, which would make it available to its pack members, who can don't have the need, but will grow in size as a result of consumption (which increases their chances at becoming alpha).</li>
</ul>
